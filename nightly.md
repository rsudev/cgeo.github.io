# Nightly Builds

If you want to test new features of upcoming versions, you can use our nightly builds. These are current development snapshots you can install manually on your device.

Nightly builds are not for live usage. You should only install these versions if you know what you're doing. These versions may not be stable. The features and changes are in alpha or beta state!

If you install one of our nightly build to your device, you will get no support for failures, errors, functions or crashes.
